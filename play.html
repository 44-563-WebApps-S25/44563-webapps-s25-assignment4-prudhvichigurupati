    <h1>Prudhvi Chigurupati Presents</h1>
    <h2>Hamlet</h2>
    <h3>Act 1, Scene 3 - A room in Polonius' house</h3>
    
    <h4 class="name laertes">LAERTES</h4>
    <p class="speech">My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
    And, sister, as the winds give benefit
    And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
    But let me hear from you.</p>

    <h4 class="name ophelia">OPHELIA</h4>
    <p class="speech">Do you doubt that?</p>

    <h4 class="name laertes">LAERTES</h4>
    <p class="speech">For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,
    Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
    A violet in the youth of primy nature,
    Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
    The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
    No more.</p>

    <h4 class="name ophelia">OPHELIA</h4>
    <p class="speech">No more but so?</p>

    <h4 class="name laertes">LAERTES</h4>
    <p class="speech">Think it no more:
    For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
    In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,
    The inward service of the mind and soul
    Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
    And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
    The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
    His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;</p>

    <h4 class="name lord_polonius">LORD POLONIUS</h4>
    <p class="stage-direction">[Entering]</p>
    <p class="speech">Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!
    The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
    And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!</p>
