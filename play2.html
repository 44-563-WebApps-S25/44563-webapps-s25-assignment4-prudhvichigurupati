    <h2>Hamlet</h2>
    <h3>Act 1, Scene 3 - Continuation</h3>
    
    <h4 class="name laertes">LAERTES</h4>
    <p class="speech">Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,
    If with too credent ear you list his songs,
    Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
    To his unmaster'd importunity.</p>

    <h4 class="name ophelia">OPHELIA</h4>
    <p class="speech">I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,
    As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
    Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
    Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;</p>

    <h4 class="name lord_polonius">Lord POLONIUS</h4>
    <p class="speech">Give thy thoughts no tongue,
    Nor any unproportioned thought his act.
    Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.</p>
